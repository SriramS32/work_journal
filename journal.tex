\section{Introduction}

The following is just a journal of my daily activities and thoughts. Many ideas will be cursory without background knowledge, which I may research thoroughly and pursue more in depth.

\subparagraph{Work}
Spent about twenty minutes today with some friends figuring out the best way to implement a n-dimensional array in C using dynamic allocation and trying to make the memory contiguous and easily accessible. I was also trying to understand how Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) are generated for audio parametrization in speech processing. A lot of the signal processing to parametrize the audio is motivated by how we hear in the cochlea, but the last ste is a Discrete Cosine Transform. Apparently the DCT is similar to Principal COmponent Analysis, which both involve something called a Karhunen-Loeve transform. Somehow the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix are involved, and I was trying to make sense of what those meant and how using those as a basis minimized mean squared error.
\subparagraph{Ideas}
Idea forum? Maybe make a web app template with database support, auth, which uses a couple of modern tools in a pipeline for startups and new developers to use. LSTM for web syntax then link of text descriptions of websites and try to be able to generate websites (HTML, CSS, JS) given a text description of the desired site. Look at what is being done for generating images from text (\href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.05396.pdf}{Ex 1} and \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.02793.pdf}{2})
